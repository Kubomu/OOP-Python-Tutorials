# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python

Welcome to the OOP in Python tutorial repository! This repository contains a series of Python scripts designed to teach the core concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). Each concept is explained with examples and exercises to help you understand how to write clean, modular, and reusable code using OOP principles.

## Introduction

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic. Python supports OOP principles such as:

- **Classes and Objects**
- **Encapsulation**
- **Inheritance**
- **Polymorphism**
- **Abstraction**

OOP helps in making code reusable, easier to maintain, and closer to real-world modeling. This repository aims to introduce these concepts step-by-step, with examples to make learning OOP in Python easy and interactive.

## Concepts Covered

### 1. **Classes and Objects**
Learn the basics of classes and objects. Understand how to define a class and instantiate objects in Python.

### 2. **Encapsulation**
Understand how encapsulating data and methods within a class can help protect the internal state of objects.

### 3. **Inheritance**
Learn how classes can inherit attributes and methods from other classes to promote code reuse.

### 4. **Polymorphism**
Understand how polymorphism allows objects to be treated as instances of their parent class, and how method overriding works.

### 5. **Abstraction**
Learn how abstraction hides complex implementation details and shows only essential features to the user.

### 6. **Magic Methods**
Explore Python's built-in methods (dunder methods) that allow you to customize the behavior of your classes.

## Code Examples

In this repository, each topic is covered in separate Python files, including:

- `01_basic_oop_concepts.py` - Introduction to classes and objects
- `02_encapsulation.py` - Encapsulation and private attributes
- `03_inheritance.py` - Understanding inheritance in Python
- `04_polymorphism.py` - Using polymorphism for code reusability
- `05_abstraction.py` - Working with abstract base classes
- `06_magic_methods.py` - Understanding magic methods like `__init__`, `__str__`, and `__add__`
- `07_exercises.py` - A series of exercises to test your knowledge of OOP

## Exercises

At the end of each concept, there are practical exercises for you to work on. These exercises will help you reinforce your understanding and apply what you’ve learned in real-world scenarios.
