# Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python

To create an effective GitHub repository teaching Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python, you can structure it step-by-step with explanations, examples, and hands-on exercises. Below is a guide for the contents you can add, including explanations and code examples.

## 1. Introduction to OOP

Start with a brief explanation of what OOP is, its principles, and why it’s useful.

### What is OOP?

Object-Oriented Programming is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which can contain data in the form of fields (often known as attributes or properties) and code, in the form of procedures (often known as methods).  
OOP allows for code reusability, better organization, and easier maintenance.

### Why use OOP?

OOP helps you model real-world systems, maintain a cleaner and modular codebase, and avoid repetition.

## Topics to cover:

- Classes and Objects
- Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Abstraction
